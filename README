To compile, run "ghc -o NQueens -O3 NQueens.hs".

To run:

./NQueens (rr/nr) (num_trials)

rr => Random Restart Mode
nr => No Restart Mode


.nqueens files produced should show the path taken from a particular start state.
They are just ascii text files. The name of the file is the original start state.

You can modify the NQueens.hs file to increase the board size in order to solve larger chess boards.
